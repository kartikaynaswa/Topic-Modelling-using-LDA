# Topic-Modelling-using-LDA
Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique to detect word and phrase patterns in documents, and to automatically cluster word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents.
This project finds the topics in a dataset of reviews.
The "topics" produced by this project as output are clusters of similar words which are presented in a form of wordcloud at the end of project
